# MATLAB solvers

These solvers were edited from the solvers available at [this link](http://www.siam.org/books/fa01/), where you can find MATLAB code written by C. T. Kelley (2003).

I plan to edit the code for my needs, and in particular to inject a more efficient version of `dirder.m` when the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian is known.
